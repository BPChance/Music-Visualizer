# Music Visualizer
## Project Overview
The Music Visualizer is an reactive webpage that blends audio-reactive visualizations with a simple but modern user interface. This project allows users to experience music in a new dimension by immersing them in visuals that sync with the mood of the music.
## Features
* Dynamic Background Visualizer: A canvas based animation that reacts to audio to create a mezmerizering background
* Genre Mood Buttons: Buttons that allow users to switch the mood between a beauiful sparkling effect, or they can go for the original type of vibe and look at waves
* Responsive: Responsive design using Tailwind to fit different device layouts
* Web Audio API: We utilized the Web Audio API to speak with the JS and create something beautiful that will be remembered for decades
* Tailwind: We used Tailwind for easy and efficient styling
## Technologies
* HTML - Structure the web pages
* Tailwind - Styling and responsive design
* JavaScript - To control interactivity and visuals
